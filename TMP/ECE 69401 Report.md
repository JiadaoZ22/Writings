## Modeling and Developing Sustainable Transportation System

Dr. Hua Cai

02/20/2020

> Dr. Cai's talking introduced agent-baed multi-model of urban transportation scheduling. It is a quite interesting topic considering various intelligent levels of ride share problem. They also consider about the charging infrastructure for shared autonomous electric vehicle and that inspired me, maybe we should pay some attention to next generation's tide instead of be limited by current knowledge boundary.

## Consensus-Based Distribvuted Computation in Multi-agent Model Algorithms, Scalability and Resilience

Dr. Shaoshuai Mo

> Dr. Mo first played a short movie piece which drew my interest for artifical intelligent. This lecture contained lots of math equation to explain their works in how to lower the compuatation in multi-agents model where shared information is limited and how to make everything asynchronously all-the-time. While I work in ML field, I am interested in how their distributed algorithms could solve a least square solution within linear time.

## Industry 4.0 & Block Chains

> The presenter introduce the deifnition and usage case of block chains, though I have heard it many many times before, I am not exactly understand it before this seminar. He did it step by step, from how to create the first block to how to append new block towards the previous one. It is an interesting topic, considering the hotness of BitCoin in those years, ECE techniques are helpful in building up a realiable and efficient system for block chains.
