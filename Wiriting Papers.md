# Wiriting Papers*

## Definitions

> - **interpretability** is about being able to discern the mechanics without  necessarily knowing why. **Explainability** is being able to quite literally explain what is happening.
> - Metrics**: describe the system/standard of measurement.
> - "**ablation study**" has been adopted to describe a procedure where certain parts of the network are removed in order to gain a better understanding of the model.
> - 

## Substituation

> - **Benchmark** == a standard method which already performs well
> - The big **payoff** of XXX is...
> - **promote** the further applications
> - ﻿**Anomalies** can be defined as events that **deviate** significantly from the patterns observed in real data.
> - severe **signal distortion** may be **triggered**
> - ﻿A **rhythmic** time series T contains **sub-series**, i.e. beats
> - ﻿BeatGAN **pinpoints** the time ticks involved in the anomalous patterns == indentify/determine
> - **Variation** == spread, dispersion, scatter, variability
> - $\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{T,N}$ is a multivariate time series
> - **Albeit** == in spite of that
> - **temporal dimension** !!!
> - **Deficiency** == shortage == **inadequacy** == **scantiness**
> - ABBRIVIATIONS
>   - **w.r.t** == **with respect to** 
>   - **i.e**. == **in other words**
>   - **e.g.** == **for example**
> - **Discrepency** == inconsistancy
> - Single-channel signals are considered **preferential** for **facilitating** this research
> - **Disparties** = difference(s)
> - **Undergo** == go through == experience
> - **Afore** == ahead of == ~~preminarily~~  <==> after == following
>   - Referrencing the aforementioned task, ...
