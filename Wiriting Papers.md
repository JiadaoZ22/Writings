## Definitions

> - **interpretability** is about being able to discern the mechanics without  necessarily knowing why. **Explainability** is being able to quite literally explain what is happening.
> - Metrics**: describe the system/standard of measurement.
> - "**ablation study**" has been adopted to describe a procedure where certain parts of the network are removed in order to gain a better understanding of the model.
> -  A "**trajectory**" is the sequence of what has happened (in terms of state, action, reward) over a set of contiguous timestamps, from a single  episode, or a single part of a continuous problem.
> - In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a **manifold** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space) that locally resembles [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) near each point.  More precisely, each point of an *n*-dimensional manifold has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics)) that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic) to the Euclidean space of dimension *n*. In this more precise terminology, a manifold is referred to as an ***n*-manifold**.
> - In general terms, a **modality** refers to the way in which something  happens or is experienced.
>   - Most  peopleassociate the word modality with the sensory  modalities which represent our primary channels of communicationand sensation, such as vision or touch. A research problemor dataset is therefore characterized as **multimodal** when  it includes multiple such modalities. 
>   - The experimental results demonstrate that **modality fusion** (fusion: merging/combining) with multimodal deep neural networks can significantly enhance the performance compared with a single modality。
> - SoTA == **State of The Art**
> - **Ablation** analysis: evaluate by removing components
> - Answer12

## Substituation

> - **Benchmark** == a standard method which already performs well
> - The big **payoff** of XXX is...
> - **promote** the further applications
> - ﻿**Anomalies** can be defined as events that **deviate** significantly from the patterns observed in real data.
> - severe **signal distortion** may be **triggered**
> - ﻿A **rhythmic** time series T contains **sub-series**, i.e. beats
> - ﻿BeatGAN **pinpoints** the time ticks involved in the anomalous patterns == indentify/determine
> - **Variation** == spread, dispersion, scatter, variability
> - $\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{T,N}$ is a multivariate time series
> - **Albeit** == in spite of that
> - **temporal dimension** !!!
> - **Deficiency** == shortage == **inadequacy** == **scantiness**
> - ABBRIVIATIONS
>   - **w.r.t** == **with respect to** 
>   - **i.e**. == **in other words**
>   - **e.g.** == **for example**
> - **Discrepency** == inconsistancy
> - Single-channel signals are considered **preferential** for **facilitating** this research
> - **Disparties** = difference(s)
> - **Undergo** == go through == experience
> - **Afore** == ahead of == ~~preminarily~~  <==> after == following
>   - Referrencing the aforementioned task, ...
> - **Inherent** == built-in = **intrinsic** == **immanent**
> - Physiological == biomediacal
> - **Peculiar** == particular = specific == strange
> - **Adopt** == choose
> - **saliency** == salience == **prominence** == noticeable
