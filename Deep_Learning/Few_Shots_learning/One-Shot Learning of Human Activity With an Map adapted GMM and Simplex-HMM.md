# One-Shot Learning of Human Activity With an Map adapted GMM and Simplex-HMM

## Abstract

> The method uses a universal background model of local descriptors obtained from source databases available online and adapts it to a new sequence in the target scenario through a maximum *a posteriori* adaptation. Each activity samples is encoded in q sequence of normalized bag of features and modeled by a new HMM, where the expectation-maximization algorithm for training is modified to deal with observation consisting in vectors in a unit simplex.
