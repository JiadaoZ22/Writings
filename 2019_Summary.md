# Jiadao's 2019 Summary

## Progress in last semester

> - Applied CNN in isolated Jap strokes recognition with accuracy around 94%.
> - Studied how to depress learning fluctuation and limited the validating accuracy within 5% and validating loss within 0.1 generally.
> - Worked on using RNN to learn the continuous eyeball-writing signals.

## Aspects to be improve

> - Researching *word-level* and *sentence-level* eyeball-writing recognition tasks, in Japanese and in English.
> - Studying more RNN and CNN models and reading relevant papers everyday.

## Expectations on new semester

> - Got the coding works done before March.
> - Got the work published before spring semester ending.
